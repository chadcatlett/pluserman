====

pluserman provides a simple API for managing users and groups.

Getting started
---------------

To give pluserman a spin, use the provided Vagrantfile.

Type `vagrant up` and once it's done booting 127.0.0.1:8080 will let you access the service without having to login to VM.

If you'd like to run the tests, you can access the typing `vagrant ssh`. Once SSHed in, type `cd /vagrant` to get into the pluserman's code directory. From here you can run `python test_pluserman.py -v` to run the tests.
